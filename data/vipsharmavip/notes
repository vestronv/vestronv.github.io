#combinatorics
Number of string Y that can be formed from X such that only one swap allowed is 
SUMMATION(A[i]*A[j]), where 'a'<=i<j<='z' and A[i] is frequency of charater(a-z)

Number of ways of choosing atmost `n` elements in range `l` to `r` such that repetition
are allowed and should in increasing order is C(r-l+1+n, n)-1
in general to choose `k` elemets it is C(r-l+k, k) so for atmost `n` we add all
1<=`k`<=`n`

if given an array of numbers and we can swap 2 consecutive numbers than we can make any permutation out of it... 1 2 3 4 => 3 1 4 2 (1324,3124,3142)
